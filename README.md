# c-bytes
Made at/for the [Chicago Innovate Hackathon 2023](https://www.chicagoinnovate.tech/hackathon)

Community Bytes is a project to collect and analyze the collective knowledge of the community using Rhino and Grasshopper on the [McNeel Forum](https://discourse.mcneel.com/).  Our ultimate goal is to develop a dataset which can be used to tune and/or train an LLM to act as a co-pilot for an LLM-driven Grasshopper Co-pilot.  

Here's the steps we are planning:

## 1. Collect
- gather posts from the Rhino/McNeel forum with Grasshopper Scripts attached 
## 2. Extend
- further characterize the posts with additional attributes relating to the contents of the scripts and/or other data points
## 3. Analyze
- perform analysis of the dataset with several goals in mind: Cleaning the data, qualifying it (predicting script quality), and providing insights about the data.
## 4. Document
- Document our process and our findings

if time allows, and as eventual goals, we hope/plan to pursue the following additional goals:
## 5. Apply
- Use the model to train/tune an LLM to understand the semantic connection between a description of what a script does and the contents of the script
## 6. Generate
- create new scripts using an LLM to automatically generate grasshopper components on the canvas
- possibly using/in combination with [ghPT](https://github.com/enmerk4r/GHPT)
## 7. Iterate
- analyze the quality of the scripts
- identify potential changes to improve results
