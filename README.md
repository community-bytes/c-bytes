# c-bytes
Made at/for the Chicago Innovate Hackathon 2023

Community Bytes is a project to collect and analyze the collective knowledge of the community using Rhino and Grasshopper on the McNeel Forum.  Our ultimate goal is to develop a dataset which can be used to tune and/or train an LLM to act as a co-pilot for Grasshopper development.  

Here's the steps we are planning:

1. Collect - gather posts from the Rhino/McNeel forum with Grasshopper Scripts attached 
2. Extend - further characterize the posts with additional attributes relating to the contents of the scripts and/or other data points
3. Analyze - perform analysis of the dataset with several goals in mind: Cleaning the data, qualifying it (predicting script quality), and providing insights about the data.
4. Document - Document our process and our findings
if time allows, and as eventual goals, we hope/plan to pursue the following additional goals:
5. Apply the model to train/tune an LLM to understand the semantic connection between a description of what a script does and the contents of the script
6. Generate new scripts using an LLM to automatically generate grasshopper components on the canvas
7. Analyze the quality of the scripts
